# Package4500

This package provides a minimal, reproducible example of the issue reported in
https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/issues/4500.

To reproduce the issue:
1. Clone this package, and `cd` into it
2. Run `swift test`

The below logs show that the module bundle is `nil`. This is unexpected and only
appears when using the Swift Package Manager CLI.
